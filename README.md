A web app made for my Introduction to Software Engineering Course written in TypeScript.

-Queries UBC course data and can be selected and sorted by course properties (seats, avg grade, etc.) with a frontend UI connected to a Restify server.

-Interacts with a UBC hosted API that provides the coordinates for UBC buildings.

-Developed with test driven development and contains hundreds of tests to ensure successful querying.
